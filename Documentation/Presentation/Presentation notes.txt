Summary of what we did during the holiday

- We had several client meetings and discussed his vision of the project and some potential implementations of the system. 
- We met both online and in person for scrim meeting regularly, as well and spending time pair programming on parts of the implementation.
- We have completed an early version of the Scanner, used to scan the network for information needed to be presented by the visualiser
- We have completed an early version of the Visualiser, in which this information is displayed as a graph
- We created a mock Adapter to allow us to test the Scanner implementation

Some problems we faced

- Getting an account for the amazon service we were attempting to build the visualizer for proved difficult. Thus we could not test the system properly without mocking for quite some time.
              -Possibly sub points on specific issues we encountered during this
- Our client being in Cape Town meant we could not meet in person and Skype calls were somewhat of an ineffective communication medium.

Moving Forward

- The Completion of the Adapter 
- Integration of the various parts and with the Amazon services
- Final Testing and tuning to achieve the wanted performance of the system
- Tweaking of the display for the visualizer (For better visual appeal)
- User Testing, and thus improvement of the usability of the system
